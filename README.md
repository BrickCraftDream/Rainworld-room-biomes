# Rainworld-room-biomes
Adds all rooms and their screens from Rain World, Downpour and Watcher to Minecraft as biomes. Also includes a tool for placing those biomes, inventory palettization based on the current biome and multiple graphical adjustments like removing biome border randomization and disabling per-side block shading.
